usage example

The program is coded in python, so â€Œorder to execute it, it's necesary to give
execution permission to the file, or use the command python <file> <parameters>

./planner.py <input file> 

The input file should be in PDDL format, this input file is the one generated as
the problem representation.

The output solution is shown in the standard output. In case you need to get the
solution in a file, the regular way is to redirect the output to a file
e.g.
 ./planner.py <input file>   >   output.pddl
 
 * It's no necessary to input the domain file as it has been hardcoded into the program functions.
